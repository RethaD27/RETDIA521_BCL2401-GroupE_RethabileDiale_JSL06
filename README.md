## Reflection:


What Went Well:

* Functionality: The JavaScript code effectively handled the dynamic generation of menu items and order summary, allowing for smooth user interaction.

Challenges Faced:
* Dynamic Menu Generation: Implementing the logic to dynamically generate menu items and update the order summary required careful handling of DOM 
 manipulation.
